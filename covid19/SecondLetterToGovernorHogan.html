                <p class="lead"> The Honorable Lawrence Hogan <br/>
                    Governor of Maryland
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Dear Governor Hogan,</p>
                <p class="lead">I will stand up for the well-being of the United States and my voice will be heard as an
                    ally of the Black community.</p>
                <p class="lead">Protesters are not the common enemy. Systematic oppression is the common enemy.
                    Coronavirus is the common enemy. </p>
                <p class="lead">A second wave may be imminent. Your actions in the next week may decide whether Maryland
                    and the DMV area ends up experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 much sooner than initially
                    expected.</p>
                <p class="lead">Let it be known that I take great pride in the city I grew up next to since I was 4
                    years old. The recent Baltimore protests were peaceful but put across a message I know is very
                    important to both you and I: the systematic oppression of African Americans in the United States
                    must be put to an end. I support the Black Lives Matter movement with all of my heart as I believe
                    everyone should. Now is the best time to protest and take action to put an end to the social
                    injustice the Black community currently faces. While protests will undoubtedly increase the amount
                    of people that will eventually be infected because of the nature of large crowds, now is the best
                    time to protest and take action to put an end to the social injustice the Black community currently
                    faces – George Floyd’s death will not be in vain. However, the amount of people that have been
                    gathering in large crowds across the United States will make it very easy for infections to spread
                    in the coming weeks, which is why I am once again calling on you to take action. Reopening
                    nonessential businesses will unnecessarily give even more opportunities for infections to spread.
                    Further reopening is the last thing that Maryland needs. </p>
                <p class="lead">My position that I raised to you 3 weeks ago still holds: I believe Maryland was not
                    ready and should not have begun reopening as soon as it did. Not only this, but the process of
                    reopening has been happening far too quickly considering that Maryland still has yet to see even a
                    week of a decrease in new cases. The CDC initially recommended that states see at least a consistent
                    14-day decrease in new infections before reopening – a criteria that Maryland has not even come
                    close to meeting since the beginning of the pandemic. While Maryland has met the CDC guideline of
                    maintaining a robust testing program (which I do commend you for helping establish) and has steadily
                    decreased in percentage of positive tests, simple decrease in the percentage of tests coming back
                    positive should not give clearance to further reopening as was done last week on May 29th. A
                    decrease in the percentage of positive tests simply means that more people were never actually
                    exposed to the virus are now being tested thanks to the increased accessibility of the testing
                    program. On top of this, a recent study from Johns Hopkins showed that up to 20% of all COVID-19
                    tests may return false negatives. We must account for the fact that a large percentage of negative
                    results may be false negatives. Therefore, the unaccountable decrease in positive tests should not
                    be the metric we continue to look at when considering further reopening. Before non-essential
                    businesses are reopened, we must see at least a 7-day decrease in new cases – Maryland has yet to
                    come close to a consistent decrease in new cases.</p>
                <p class="lead">“Did you see that masks are finally gonna be optional pretty much?” “Yeah, I can finally
                    breathe.” This was a conversation I overheard between two students at my apartment building in
                    College Park – in the most highly infected county in the state – but I continue to see many of my
                    peers walk into buildings and elevators without masks. A snippet of a conversation I overheard today
                    while picking up a package in my apartment: Funny how some are so quick to complain about a small
                    piece of cloth on their face meant to protect the vulnerable, yet these are the same people that do
                    not understand the Black Lives Matter movement. The amount of disrespect and ignorance between these
                    two students floored me. First of all, to equate being able to “finally breathe” amidst a time of
                    the current state of police brutality in the country is disrespectful to George Floyd’s death as
                    well as the elderly and immunocompromised. My guess is that the combination of the University of
                    Maryland school system’s announcement that classes will most likely be partially in person and your
                    recent announcement of Stage 2 of reopening has led some of my peers to further downplay the real
                    dangers that come with this pandemic. These are two students who also most likely would want to be
                    able to return to campus in the fall still dismiss the danger of a possibility of a second wave,
                    which would inevitably delay any kind of return to in-person classes. I can only imagine that other
                    Maryland residents will also choose not to take the pandemic seriously once Stage 2 begins, even
                    without the motivation that university students experience wanting to go back to campus.</p>
                <p class="lead">I truly feel that the stage of reopening that is set to happen on June 5th will be the
                    one that brings an early second wave of coronavirus to Maryland and the DMV area. Montgomery county
                    and Prince George’s county was only recently able to begin Stage 1 of reopening, and now surrounding
                    counties will begin Stage 2. Even though there are less restrictions with these counties themselves,
                    is it not reasonable to think that an increase in infections in surrounding counties will
                    inadvertently cause the number of infections in these two hard-hit counties to begin increasing at
                    an uncontrollable rate? As I stated, beginning Stage 2 of reopening will not have repercussions
                    within the state of Maryland alone. Reopening also only recently began in Northern Virginia and
                    Washington DC – despite the joint statement you released alongside Mayor Bowser and Governor Northam
                    on March 23rd promising that all 3 regions would work together to combat this pandemic. The state of
                    Maryland began reopening before Washington DC despite having a larger proportion of infected
                    individuals to total population. The easing of restrictions around counties like Prince George’s
                    county, which borders Washington DC, undoubtedly will cause another spike in cases in both
                    Washington DC and Virginia. </p>
                <p class="lead">Of course, I have reason to question where your concerns are – given you sent 120
                    members of the Maryland National Guard to DC even though this was never asked for by Mayor Bowser.
                    You never called for military force when armed white protesters demanded for states to reopen, but
                    instead encouraged Donald Trump’s response to the George Floyd protests. If you are truly worried
                    about saving lives, you would make the decision to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. Instead, it
                    seems you have opted to prioritize the economy over human lives by beginning Stage 2 of reopening
                    not even one full month after Stage 1.</p>
                <p class="lead">You will not save lives by sending the National Guard to confront peaceful protesters.
                    You will not save lives by encouraging Trump’s decisions that would further endanger Black people.
                    You will not save lives by relying on the eventual development of a vaccine to allow the number of
                    new infections to go down. Humanity will instead be left with an even bigger permanent scar that is
                    made up of the thousands of lives unnecessarily lost. It is time for a reversal of priorities. We
                    should be prioritizing peoples’ lives so that they can eventually carry out their livelihoods, not
                    prioritize peoples’ livelihoods so that they can carry out their lives. You cannot have a livelihood
                    without one’s life. You cannot have a livelihood without the lives of those around you. </p>
                <p class="lead">Black lives are essential. Protection of protesters is essential. Slowing the spread of
                    the virus is essential. Beginning Stage 2 of reopening is not essential. </p>
                <p class="lead">Governor Hogan, halt further reopening Maryland to slow the spread of COVID-19. Protect
                    protesters so that the systematic oppression of the Black community can finally be put to an
                    end. </p>
