                <p class="lead"> The Honorable Lawrence Hogan <br/>
                    Governor of Maryland
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Dear Governor Hogan,</p>
                <p class="lead">Protesters are not the common enemy. Systematic oppression is the common enemy.
                    Coronavirus is the common enemy. </p>
                <p class="lead">A second wave may be imminent. Your actions in the next week may decide whether Maryland
                    and the DMV area ends up experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 much sooner than initially
                    expected.</p>
                <p class="lead">My concern that I raised to you 3 weeks ago still holds: Maryland is reopening too quickly and is not ready for a second wave that would result. The CDC recommended a state see at least a consistent 14-day decrease in new infections. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Maryland has yet to see new cases decrease for any more than 4 days in a row. While Maryland has met the CDC criteria of maintaining a robust resting program (which I do commend you for helping establish), there are very few other statistics that support further reopening. In the past few weeks, you have countlessly cited the decrease in percentage of positive tests and the slight decrease in hospitalizations. These two numbers should not be the metric you abide by when it comes to reopening the state. The decrease in percentage of positive tests is simply an artifact of increased accessibility to testing – it does not represent a slow in infections. Additionally, a recent study from Johns Hopkins showed that up to 20% of all COVID-19 tests may return false negatives, so more testing also means more false negatives. As for the slight decrease in hospitalizations, I can only hope that this number continues to fall given the current capacity of hospitals in Maryland. Only 4% of ICU beds and only 14% of hospital beds are currently vacant. Maryland is clearly unprepared for the. Florida is a clear example of a state that opened too early and now faces the repercussions of doing so. </p>
                <p class="lead">The consequences of further reopening Maryland will show in counties like Montgomery county and Prince George’s county that are choosing to remain at Stage 1, as well as the surrounding DMV area. Montgomery county and Prince George’s county was only recently able to begin Stage 1 of reopening, and now surrounding counties will begin Stage 2. Even though there are less restrictions with these counties themselves, is it not reasonable to think that an increase in infections in surrounding counties will inadvertently cause the number of infections in these two hard-hit counties to begin increasing at an uncontrollable rate? As I stated, beginning Stage 2 of reopening will not have repercussions within the state of Maryland alone. Reopening also only recently began in Northern Virginia and Washington DC – despite the joint statement you released alongside Mayor Bowser and Governor Northam on March 23rd promising that all 3 regions would work together to combat this pandemic. The state of Maryland began reopening before Washington DC despite having a larger proportion of infected individuals to total population. The easing of restrictions around counties like Prince George’s county, which borders Washington DC, undoubtedly will cause another spike in cases in both Washington DC and Virginia. </p>
                <p class="lead">“Did you see that masks are finally gonna be optional pretty much?” “Yeah, I can’t breathe with this thing on.” This was a conversation I overheard between two students at my apartment building in  College Park – in the most highly infected county in the state – but I continue to see many of my peers walk into buildings and elevators without masks. My guess is that the combination of the University of Maryland school system’s announcement that classes will most likely be partially in person and your recent announcement of Stage 2 of reopening has caused some of my peers to be complacent. These are two students most likely would want to be able to return to campus in the fall yet dismiss the danger of a possibility of a second wave. which would inevitably delay any kind of return to in-person classes. I can only imagine that other Maryland residents will also choose not to take the pandemic seriously once Stage 2 begins, even without the motivation that university students experience wanting to go back to campus. </p>
                <p class="lead">I could not help but notice how one of the students said they “can’t breathe” – the blatant ignorance and dismissal of recent events appalled me, but it did shed light on what actions we must take now that are truly essential. Reopening non-essential businesses will cause an increase in new cases, and I understand the protests will most likely lead to the same result. However, it is crucial now that we do not let the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery be in vain. Now is the time to expose the racism and inequality the Black community continues to face. These are the priorities of decisions that you should be considering – but your actions in the past week have given me plenty of reasons to question where your priorities currently lie. </p>
                <p class="lead">“I couldn’t agree more with all of the things that you’ve said.” This is what you told Donald Trump earlier this week. You proceeded to send 120 members of the Maryland National Guard to Washington DC – even though Mayor Bowser made it clear that she did not want them there. You chose to encourage Trump’s divisive and violent tactics. Rather than denounce police brutality and make an attempt to bring the country together, Trump has chosen to cower in the White House. He has chosen to ignore the message that protesters across the country have been trying to put across. And you have only given Trump more of a reason to do so. The protests, therefore, become even more necessary. If the government and the Chief Executive himself will not stand up racial injustice, then the people must. Unlike the complaints of wearing a mask “taking away their freedom,” hindering the power of the people to advocate for an end to systematic racism is a violation of our constitutional rights. </p>
                <p class="lead">You will not save lives by sending the National Guard to confront peaceful protesters. You will not save lives by encouraging Trump’s decisions that would further endanger Black people. You will not save lives by relying on the eventual development of a vaccine to allow the number of new infections to go down. Humanity will instead be left with an even bigger permanent scar that is made up of the thousands of lives unnecessarily lost. It is time for a reversal of priorities. We should be prioritizing peoples’ lives so that they can eventually carry out their livelihoods, not prioritize peoples’ livelihoods so that they can carry out their lives. You cannot have a livelihood without one’s life. You cannot have a livelihood without the lives of those around you. </p>
                <p class="lead">Black lives are essential. Protection of protesters is essential. Slowing the spread of
                    the virus is essential. Beginning Stage 2 of reopening is not essential. You are unnecessarily
                    endangering thousands of lives.</p>
                <p class="lead">Governor Hogan, halt further reopening Maryland to slow the spread of COVID-19. Protect
                    protesters so that the systematic oppression of the Black community can finally be put to an
                    end. </p>
