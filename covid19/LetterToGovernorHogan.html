                <p class="lead"> The Honorable Lawrence Hogan <br/>
                    Governor of Maryland
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Dear Governor Hogan,</p>
                <p class="lead">The sense of urgency I feel writing this letter to you has increased drastically in the
                    last 24 hours. I no longer just want to bring attention to the lack of enforcement of stay at home
                    orders, but rather something much more serious: the pace at which Maryland is beginning to reopen is
                    too fast.</p>
                <p class="lead">I would like to begin by thanking you for all the work you have been putting in to
                    ensure the safety of Maryland during My name is Tomer Krayzman and I am a junior at the University
                    of Maryland, College Park double majoring in Computer Science and Chinese. While I normally live at
                    my apartment in College Park, I lived in Baltimore County ever since my family moved from Israel
                    when I was 4 years old up until I moved out for college and am currently residing with my mother in
                    Baltimore County due to the Coronavirus pandemic. I am writing to you in hopes of being able to
                    voice my thoughts and concerns about the way Coronavirus is handled both within Baltimore County as
                    well as Maryland overall. The added urgency comes along with the recent decision made on May 13th to
                    lift stay-at-home orders and replacing this with a “Safer at Home” advisory. Like many other
                    students, I am concerned about being able to return to campus for the Fall semester but I have found
                    that my concern surpasses my own desire to return to school – I fear that opening the state of
                    Maryland too early will lead to catastrophic consequences. Preventative measures have not been met
                    yet to ensure the safety of furthering phase one of reopening the state.</p>
                <p class="lead">Regarding the area surrounding Maryland, very few regions have begun to open which
                    should also raise questions about Maryland opening too early. It is important to note that
                    executives in Delaware, Virginia, and Washington DC have all extended their stay at home orders.
                    This follows even after a joint statement was released on March 23rd between Governor Northam, Mayor
                    Bowser, and you, Governor Hogan. This statement ensured the collaboration of the DMV region - by
                    reopening earlier than both Washington DC and Virginia, are you not failing to meet this promise? Is
                    the decision to move to a “Safer at Home” advisory not indirectly endangering residents outside of
                    Maryland? </p>
                <p class="lead">As of May 15th, multiple counties in Maryland have only partially opened with Montgomery
                    County and Prince George’s County (the current epicenters of Maryland) have all remained closed.
                    Baltimore County and Baltimore City officials released a joint statement stating the Baltimore
                    region should be cautious about opening with Baltimore City remaining closed. How effective are
                    these actions when surrounding counties are opening anyway? How can public health measures be
                    ensured if actions are not coordinated among all counties? Is it really effective to move the
                    responsibility of dealing with this pandemic from you, the governor, to county executives? President
                    Donald Trump never imposed a national lockdown and has left reopening to be a decision made by
                    individual states. Is this not what you have done by allowing individual counties to make their own
                    decisions? This strategy has proven to be ineffective on a national scale as the United States
                    quickly became the epicenter of the virus and will be even less effective at a state scale. What
                    stops someone in Baltimore City who really wants their hair cut from going to Harford County or
                    Carroll County only to bring another case back into the city? These are all factors we must take
                    into consideration. </p>
                <p class="lead">“I fully recognize that in some cases, I am choosing between saving people’s lives and
                    saving people’s livelihoods. But ultimately, you can’t have a livelihood if you don’t have your
                    life.”
                    Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois stated this after his press conference on March 20th. His
                    statement
                    fully captures what I feel a hastened push to open the state does not. While hospitalizations have
                    slightly decreased in the last 14 days, Maryland saw over 1000 daily cases consistently beginning
                    May
                    6th,
                    and the number of new cases has not yet begun to decrease. By the time restrictions are reinstated,
                    enough of the
                    public will have already been exposed and Maryland is not yet equipped to confront a second
                    outbreak.
                    In
                    other words, it is going to be much more difficult to reinstate restrictions then it will be to
                    maintain
                    them. While I have done my best to understand the perspective of those who have lost their
                    livelihoods,
                    but unemployment benefits have been increased and improved recently for this reason. I cannot help
                    but
                    agree with Governor Pritzker and that allowing Marylanders to return to their jobs will not matter
                    if
                    many
                    lives are to be lost in the process, only for strict stay at home orders to be renewed.
                    Even as a student paying tuition with loans, I would be willing to donate to a fund that would aid
                    Maryland’s small businesses.</p>
                <p class="lead">Stay at home orders, at least in Baltimore County, have not been adhered to either. I
                    currently live with my mother and her boyfriend who are both high risk individuals due to their age,
                    as
                    well as my brother who is 19 years old. While my brother and I are less likely to be strongly
                    impacted
                    by
                    the virus, I fear for the well-being of my mother. I tried filing a police report on my brother who
                    was
                    consistently breaking stay at home orders by going out of the house for elongated periods of time
                    and
                    meeting with multiple friends to smoke, but on two different occasions when I called the Baltimore
                    County
                    I was told, “There really isn’t much we can do here. You could maybe guilt him and tell him this is
                    for
                    the sake of your mom, but he technically isn’t committing a real crime.” This kind of complacency
                    will
                    not
                    allow Maryland, much less the entirety of the United States to heal. I can only imagine the large
                    number
                    of individuals who, like my brother, choose to remain ignorant to the current state of this
                    pandemic.
                    I
                    fear that this level of ignorance will only be further encouraged with a lifting of stay at home
                    orders.
                    The type of individual that chooses to believe that the virus is not bigger than themselves will not
                    adhere to a “Safer at Home” advisory.</p>
                <p class="lead">Over the past two weeks, Maryland has been consistently gaining over 1000 new cases a
                    day. On May 13th, it was stated that Maryland would begin Stage 1 of reopening due to the number of
                    hospitalizations having gone down, but these numbers had only gone down slightly. At the same time,
                    the number of cases in the ICU have increased, so is it really safe to base a reopening of the state
                    based on the slight improvement in hospitalizations? New cases in Maryland have not even begun to
                    decrease, so has Maryland truly met the benchmarks that states like Rhode Island have to reopen? On
                    the other hand, states like Texas that reopened too early now face repercussions, having over 1000
                    new cases daily for the past 5 days. While these statistics relating to the virus obviously do not
                    reflect Maryland’s, the spread of the virus will not stop just because it crosses state lines,
                    therefore I think decision to partially reopen Maryland is rash and will cause a new surge of cases
                    in the weeks to come. The US can learn from countries like Taiwan and Australia (countries with
                    populations nearly 8 times larger than Maryland’s) which were all able to enforce restrictions that
                    have allowed for their quick recovery and safe reopening.</p>
                <p class="lead">I fear that the recent decision to begin phase one of reopening Maryland will lead to
                    consequences that are going to be extraordinarily difficult to recover from. I used to simply fear
                    for
                    my
                    family, my friends, and my ability to return to campus in the Fall. I now fear for the well-being of
                    the
                    state and country I had the opportunity to grow up in.</p>
                <p class="lead">I hope you take all of this into consideration in your actions concerning the fight
                    against
                    Coronavirus. If there is anything that individual residents like myself can do to help the fight,
                    please
                    do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. Your leadership
                    through this pandemic has proved to Democrats and Republicans alike that fighting this virus is not
                    a
                    partisan issue, and this is something I am truly grateful for.</p>
                <p class="lead">For the sake of Maryland and the United States, please reconsider the rate at which we
                    move through the state’s recovery and reopening plan.</p>
                <p class="lead">Sincerely, <br/>
