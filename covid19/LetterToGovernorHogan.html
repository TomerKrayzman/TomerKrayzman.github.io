            <p class="lead"> The Honorable Lawrence Hogan <br/>
              Governor of Maryland
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Dear Governor Hogan,</p>
            <p class="lead">The sense of urgency I feel writing this letter to you has increased drastically in the last
              24 hours. I no longer just want to bring attention to the lack of enforcement of stay at home orders, but
              rather something much more serious: Maryland is not yet ready to reopen.</p>
            <p class="lead">I would like to begin by thanking you for all the work you have been putting in to ensure
              the safety of Maryland during My name is Tomer Krayzman and I am a junior at the University of Maryland,
              College Park double majoring in Computer Science and Chinese. While I normally live at my apartment in
              College Park, I lived in Baltimore County ever since my family moved from Israel when I was 4 years old up
              until I moved out for college and am currently residing with my mother in Baltimore County due to the
              Coronavirus pandemic. I am writing to you out in hopes of being able to voice my thoughts and concerns
              about the way Coronavirus is handled both within Baltimore County as well as Maryland overall. The added
              urgency comes along with the recent decision made on May 13th to lift stay-at-home orders and replacing
              this with a “Safer at Home” advisory. Like many other students, I am concerned about being able to return
              to campus for the Fall semester but I have found that my concern surpasses my own desire to return to
              school – I fear that opening the state of Maryland too early will lead to catastrophic consequences.
              Preventative measures have not been met yet to ensure the safety of furthering phase one of reopening the
              state.</p>
            <p class="lead">Regarding the area surrounding Maryland, very few regions have begun to open which should
              also raise questions about Maryland opening too early. It is important to note that stay at home orders
              have been extended in Northern Virginia, DC, Delaware, and Pennsylvania have all extended their stay at
              home orders to June. On the other hand, states like Texas that reopened too early now face repercussions,
              having over 1000 new cases daily for the past 5 days. While these statistics relating to the virus don’t
              obviously don’t reflect Maryland’s, the spread of the virus will not stop just because it crosses state
              lines, therefore I think decision to partially reopen Maryland tomorrow is rash and will cause a new surge
              of cases in the weeks to come. The US can learn from countries like Taiwan and Australia (countries with
              populations nearly 8 times larger than Maryland’s) which were all able to enforce restrictions that have
              allowed for their quick recovery and safe reopening.</p>
            <p class="lead">“I fully recognize that in some cases, I am choosing between saving people’s lives and
              saving people’s livelihoods. But ultimately, you can’t have a livelihood if you don’t have your life.”
              Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois stated this after his press conference on March 20th. His statement
              fully captures what I feel a hastened push to open the state does not. While hospitalizations have
              slightly decreased in the last 14 days, Maryland saw over 1000 daily cases consistently beginning May 6th,
              with numbers only recently beginning to decrease. By the time restrictions are reinstated, enough of the
              public will have already been exposed and Maryland is not yet equipped to confront a second outbreak. In
              other words, it is going to be much more difficult to reinstate restrictions then it will be to maintain
              them. While I have done my best to understand the perspective of those who have lost their livelihoods,
              but unemployment benefits have been increased and improved recently for this reason. I cannot help but
              agree with Governor Pritzker and that allowing Marylanders to return to their jobs will not matter if many
              lives are to be lost in the process, only for strict stay at home orders to be renewed.</p>
            <p class="lead">Stay at home orders, at least in Baltimore County, have not been adhered to either. I
              currently live with my mother and her boyfriend who are both high risk individuals due to their age, as
              well as my brother who is 19 years old. While my brother and I are less likely to be strongly impacted by
              the virus, I fear for the well-being of my mother. I tried filing a police report on my brother who was
              consistently breaking stay at home orders by going out of the house for elongated periods of time and
              meeting with multiple friends to smoke, but on two different occasions when I called the Baltimore County
              I was told, “There really isn’t much we can do here. You could may be guilt him and tell him this is for
              the sake of your mom, but he technically isn’t committing a real crime.” This kind of complacency will not
              allow Maryland, much less the entirety of the United States to heal. I can only imagine the large number
              of individuals who, like my brother, choose to remain ignorant to the current state of this pandemic. I
              fear that this level of ignorance will only be further encouraged with a lifting of stay at home orders.
              The type of individual that chooses to believe that the virus is not bigger than themselves will not
              adhere to a “Safer at Home” advisory.</p>
            <p class="lead">I fear that the recent decision to begin phase one of reopening Maryland will lead to
              consequences that are going to be extraordinarily difficult to recover from. I used to simply fear for my
              family, my friends, and my ability to return to campus in the Fall. I now fear for the well-being of the
              state and country I had the opportunity to grow up in.</p>
            <p class="lead">I hope you take all of this into consideration in your actions concerning the fight against
              Coronavirus. If there is anything that individual residents like myself can do to help the fight, please
              do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. Your leadership
              through this pandemic has proved to Democrats and Republicans alike that fighting this virus is not a
              partisan issue, and this is something I am truly grateful for.</p>
            <p class="lead">For the sake of Maryland and the United States, please reconsider the decision to reopen the
              state and lift stay at home restrictions.</p>
            <p class="lead">Sincerely, <br/>
